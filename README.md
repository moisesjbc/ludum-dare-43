## About

The world of magicians is suffering a zombies apocalypse!

Help the great magician Duof (*) to survive as long as you can by fighting back hordes of zombies trying to drain your life (red magicians) or your time (green ones).

Use your spells book to defend yourself, but be aware: spells will cost you your life / time as well! 

One last note: healing powerups will randomly appear on the map,  so keep moving and look for them!

(*) From "Du oferoj" ("Two sacrifices", in Esperanto)

## Controls

* W, A, S, D: move
* Mouse move: aim
* Mouse left button: shoot
